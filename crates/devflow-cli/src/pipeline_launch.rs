//! Pipeline seam A (D-06): launching a stage's agent and driving the
//! `advance` decision after a monitored agent exits. Extracted mechanically
//! (19-08, D-09 pure move) out of `main.rs` — every function below is
//! byte-identical to its pre-move body modulo an added `pub(crate)` and
//! adjusted `use` paths.
//!
//! **This module participates in the pipeline's three-way module cycle
//! (19-RESEARCH.md Pattern 1), and that is intentional:** [`launch_stage`]
//! calls [`crate::preflight::run_preflight`] on the way in, while
//! `run_preflight`'s `Advance` arm calls [`launch_stage_inner`] back
//! directly (18-07, D-18f) — the bidirectional preflight/launch pair is
//! unchanged by this split, just repointed to a named module. Closing the
//! OTHER side of the cycle, `pipeline_gate::transition` (and
//! `loop_back_to_code`) call [`launch_stage`] at their last line — that
//! call is what actually drives the state machine forward after a stage
//! transition, and is the edge that closes `launch → outcomes → gate →
//! launch` back to this module. Rust permits cyclic module references
//! (only the crate dependency graph must be acyclic), so this compiles
//! cleanly. All three pipeline modules import from each other directly —
//! see `pipeline_gate`'s module doc comment for the explicit caveat that
//! this cycle is NOT a wave-parallelism promise for future pipeline work.
